# outlier_detection
Building the predictive analytics model to help banks to predict whether the customer will default the loan or not


# Data
In this project, I'll explore and cleanse a dataset consisting of over 150000 loan records to determine the best way to predict whether the customer will default the loan or not on a loan. 

# what is the output of our algorithm?
I build a machine learning model that returns the unique loan ID and a column for the probability that indicates the chance of the borrowers pay the loan.

# Steps to Follow
by Aurélien Géron
1- Frame the problem and look at the big picture.

2- Get the data.

3- Explore the data to gain insights.

4- Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to Machine Learning algorithms.

5- Explore many different models and shortlist the best ones.

6- Fine-tune your models and combine them into a great solution.

7- Present your solution.

8- Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.
