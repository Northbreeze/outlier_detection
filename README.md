# outlier_detection
Building the predictive analytics model to help banks to predict whether the customer will default the loan or not


# Data
In this project, I'll explore and cleanse a dataset consisting of over 150000 loan records to determine the best way to predict whether the customer will default the loan or not on a loan. 

# what is the output of our algorithm?
I build a machine learning model that returns the unique loan ID and a column for the probability that indicates the chance of the borrowers pay the loan.

# Steps to Follo
 1- Feaure Engineering for the baseline model
 2- Selecting machine learning algorithms
 3- Training the model
 4- Testing the base model
 5- Optimizing the existing approach
